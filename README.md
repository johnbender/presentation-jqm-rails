# jQM on Rails Presentation

This presentation is really two presentations. First, it's an attempt to dispell the "webkit solves all the problems" myth. Second, it covers some of the important gotchas/notes when building a jquery mobile app with rails.

# Presence app iframe

If you want to view the presentation or use the slides the iframed sample application references a [rails app](https://github.com/johnbender/jqm-rails). Yours truly runs the application in a vagrant vm but it's a vanilla rails app so getting it up and running and chainging the iframe link should be trivial.
